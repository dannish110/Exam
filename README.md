DEMONSTRATE LED Blinking in iot Device
AIM
To understand and implement basic digital output using an Arduino by blinking an LED.

APPARATUS
Arduino UNO board

LED

Resistors (220Î©)

Breadboard

Jumper wires

USB Cable

OBJECTIVE
To write and upload a simple program to the Arduino that makes an LED blink at regular intervals, demonstrating the control of digital outputs.

THEORY
An LED is a basic electronic component that emits light when current flows through it. In IoT, controlling LEDs is often the first step in learning how to handle digital output. The digitalWrite() function in Arduino code sets the voltage of a pin to HIGH or LOW, allowing us to blink an LED by turning it on and off.
